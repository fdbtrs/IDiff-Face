The availability of large-scale authentic face databases has been crucial to the significant advances made in face recognition research over the past decade. However, recent legal and ethical concerns led to the retraction of many of these databases by their creators, raising questions about the continuity of future face recognition research without one of its key resources. Synthetic face datasets have emerged as a promising alternative to privacy-sensitive authentic data for face recognition development. However, recent synthetic datasets that are used to train face recognition models suffer either from limitations in intra-class diversity or cross-class (identity) discrimination, leading to less optimal verification accuracies, far away from the accuracies achieved by models trained on authentic data. This paper targets this issue by proposing IDiff-Face, a novel approach based on conditional latent diffusion models for synthetic identity generation with realistic identity variations for face recognition training. Through extensive evaluations, our proposed synthetic-based face recognition approach pushed the limits of state-of-the-art performances, achieving, for example, 98.00% accuracy on the LFW benchmark, far ahead from the recent synthetic-based face recognition solutions with 95.40% and closing the gap to authentic-based face recognition with 99.82% accuracy.

### Download for the setup
Download links for the pre-trained autoencoder weights that originally come from the `fhq256` LDM from [Rombach et al.](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/blob/main/models/ldm/ffhq256/config.yaml) and strictly follow their licence. Their VQModelInterface submodule has been manually extracted and split into its encoder and decoder models, since the encoder is only used during training and the decoder is only needed for sampling:
- [Encoder and decoder model weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d-zs3yjsnzOMNkz7qy3JSb-fMf0UmSdT?usp=sharing)

The resulting .pt files  are then expected to be saved under `models/autoencoder/first_stage_encoder_state_dict.pt` and `models/autoencoder/first_stage_decoder_state_dict.pt`, respectively.

## Results

The following table shows the verification benchmark performances achieved by methods from related work in comparison to the ones of our proposed IDiff-Face approach. They have been reported by the respective authors themselves. For face recognition training on our synthetic (uniform) data, we used a ResNet-50 with an CosFace loss, which is exactly the same setup that has been used in the SFace and USynthFace works. More detailed results are presented in the paper.

## How to use the code?

It includes the main scripts used for training and evaluating the IDiff-Face models. All experiments of this project were conducted within a Docker container, whose `Dockerfile` is included in this archive. However, the scripts are itself not depending on Docker and thus the commands provided in this README to run the scripts are kept basic and thus might have to be slightly altered to match the specific environment of the user. 
You also might have to alter the root paths under `configs/paths/gpuc_cluster.yaml`.

### Setup
Download the [FFHQ dataset (128x128)](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset) and put the `70.000` unlabelled images under `data/ffhq_128/`. The training embeddings used as contexts during training are NOT provided under `data/embeddings_elasticface_128.npy` and can be extracted using the `extract_face_embeddings_from_dir.py` script. 
For that, the pre-trained ElasticFace-Arc model weights have to be downloaded from the [official ElasticFace repository](https://github.com/fdbtrs/ElasticFace) and placed under `utils/Elastic_R100_295672backbone.pth`. 
The [pre-trained autoencoder](https://ommer-lab.com/files/latent-diffusion/ffhq.zip) for the latent diffusion training is obtained from the pre-trained `fhq256` LDM from [Rombach et al.](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/blob/main/models/ldm/ffhq256/config.yaml) please follow their licence distribution. For more information, see the downloads section above.

### Training a IDiff-Face model
In order to train the model with 25% CPD make sure that the option `model: unet_cond_ca_cpd25` is set in the `configs/train_config.yaml`. The CPD probability can be changed by creating a new model specification in the `configs/model/` subconfiguration folder. 
In addition to that, it has to be ensured that the `dataset: ffhq_folder` option is set and that the paths in the corresponding subconfiguration `configs/dataset/ffhq_folder.yaml` are pointing to the training images and pre-extracted embeddings. The model training can be initiated by executing:
    
    python main.py
     

**Naming the trained model**: After the model is trained, the model output directory content under `outputs/DATE/TIME/` can be copied to another folder e.g. `trained_models/unet-cond-ca-bs512-150K-cpd25/`. The name of this new folder is now referred to as the MODEL_NAME of the trained model.

### Sampling with a (pre-trained) IDiff-Face model
<span style="color: red">***** Update ***** </span>

<span style="color: red"> The requirements (requirements_sampling.txt) is exported from pip list and added to the project folder. </span>

- <span style="color: red"> Install python 3.7.4   </span>
- <span style="color: red"> run pip install -r.  </span>
- <span style="color: red"> Download the pretrained models including ".hydra" folder and place it inside trained_models.  See download section </span>
- <span style="color: red"> Download Encoder and decoder and place them inside models/autoencoder. See download section </span>




For reproducibility and consistency, the synthetic contexts are NOT generated on-the-fly during sampling. Instead, they are pre-generated and saved in `.npy` files, which contain Python `dicts` with identity_names/dummy_names as keys and the associated context vector as value. This is the same structure used for the training embeddings. In this archive, some pre-generated `two-stage` contexts are already included. In order to generate samples with `synthetic_uniform` contexts, quickly execute the `create_sample_identity_contexts.py` script, which will pre-compute 15.000 synthetic uniform contexts that you can use for sampling. Then, specify the path to the trained model and the contexts file that shall be used for sampling in the `sample_config.yaml`. There you can also configure the number of identities to use from the provided contexts file and the number of images per identity context. Those samples will be saved under `samples/MODEL_NAME/CONTEXT_NAME` as identity blocks, e.g. a 4x4 grid block of 128x128 images (total block size is then 512x512). These blocks can then be splitted using e.g. then `split_identity_blocks.py` script. But before doing that, they have to be aligned. The sampling script can be started via:
    
    python create_sample_identity_contexts.py
    python sample.py
     
    
**Aligning the samples**: Aligning the images using MTCNN detection and ArcFace alignment is simply done by executing the `align.py` script after having specified every data that shall be aligned in the `align_config.yaml`. Currently, when alignment for one image per identity fails, the entire identity block is instead just resized to 112x112 instead of proper alignment. This option can be disabled by setting `just_resize_if_fail: False` in the config. Then, the entire block will be discarded instead. For the generation of 10.000 identities with 50 samples each, 10.050 identities were initially sampled from 15.000 pre-generated contexts to account for future alignment failures and thereby make sure that at least 10.000 identities with 50 aligned images are available for the large-scale training.

    
    python align.py
    
    
**Splitting the blocks**: Just execute the `split_identity_blocks.py` script after ensuring that the paths are correct. The script is very straightforward and easy to modify if any issues should occur.
    
    python split_identity_blocks.py

## Training a Face Recognition (FR) model
The dependencies for training the FR model are different. We used the training setup of [USynthFace](https://github.com/fdbtrs/Unsupervised-Face-Recognition-using-Unlabeled-Synthetic-Data) and are thus referring to that for the dependencies. With the code provided under `face_recognition_training/`, the training of a CosFace FR model with the configuration file under `face_recognition_training/config/config.py` that can be changed should be started via:

    
    ./training_large_scale_with_augment.sh
